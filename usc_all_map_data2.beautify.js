    "short": "Perhaps the best-known fountain on the University Park campus, \"Youth Triumphant\" was presented to USC in 1935 by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Carman-Ryles i memory of their son, alumnus Edward L. Prentiss, and installed in Alumni Memorial Park in front of Doheny Memorial Library. The original, called \"The Four Cornerstones of American Democracy,\" was displayed at the 1935-36 California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego's Balboa Park, and the sculptor, Bavarian-born Frederick William Schweigardt, received the gold medal for distinguished service for the work. The four kneeling caryatid figures supporting the bowl represent School, Home, Community and Church. Above them, the bronze figure of youth dances on top of the world. In 1976, the fountain was damaged by falling trees; it was recast and reinstalled in 1979 thanks to financial support from the Trojan League of Los Angeles.",
